# Asteroid NEO (Near-Earth Object) Research Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the study and analysis of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using advanced data analysis techniques and interactive web applications. It combines the power of R, Python, and Power BI to create insightful visualizations and predictive models, presented through user-friendly interfaces.

## Key Features

### 1. **R Analysis and Visualizations**
- Performed comprehensive analysis using R.
- Created interactive visualizations, including:
  - **Heatmap**: To highlight patterns in the dataset.
  - **Treemap**: To showcase hierarchical data.
  - **Bar Graph**: To visualize categorical distributions.
- Trained a **Random Forest Machine Learning Model** to predict outcomes and derive insights.
- Integrated all visualizations and predictions into an **R Shiny Web Application** hosted locally.

### 2. **Django Web Application**
- Developed a web application in Python using Django to enhance the presentation of the R Shiny app.
- Features:
  - **User-Friendly Interface**: Bright and intuitive design.
  - **Quick Navigation**: Browse the entire project on a single page.
  - **Account Management**:
    - Email-based account creation.
    - OTP-based activation and login.
- Embeds the R Shiny application seamlessly for an integrated experience.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard**
- Created an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** using the same dataset.
- Provides a glimpse of additional insights and visualizations through the web application.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **R**: Data analysis, visualization, machine learning.
- **Shiny**: Interactive web application hosting for R analysis.
- **Python & Django**: Web development and UI enhancement.
- **Power BI**: Dashboard creation for advanced insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R and Shiny installed for local server hosting.
- Python 3.x and Django for web application deployment.
- Power BI Desktop for dashboard interaction.

### Running the Project
1. **R Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the R project directory.
   - Run the R script to generate visualizations and train the ML model.
   - Launch the Shiny app using the RStudio environment.

2. **Django Web Application**:
   - Navigate to the Django project directory.
   - Run the development server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Access the web application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

3. **Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Open the Power BI file provided in the repository to explore the dataset further.

## Project Highlights
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple technologies to deliver an engaging, user-focused solution for analyzing and presenting NEO data. By combining R Shiny, Django, and Power BI, it provides a seamless experience for data exploration, prediction, and insight generation.
